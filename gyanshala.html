<h1>About Gyanshala<br />
</h1>
<p><br />
  Through the instruction of Jainism and Science of Living, JVBNA Gyanshala strives to impart to its students, life skills for physical, mental and emotional health, a stress free and peaceful life, and spiritual bliss. It also strives to inculcate life values in children that help them grow into responsible adults – adults, who respect and care for their fellow living beings and the environment, who respect other religious beliefs and have empathy for those who are less fortunate.</p>
<p>With the blessings of H.H. Acharyashri Mahapragya and under the guidance of Samanijis, JVB NJ Gyanshala for children opened its doors in the fall of 2004 and has been running successfully since then. It is open to all children ages of 4 years and up, who want to learn Jainism, Science of Living (Prayer, Yoga, and Meditation) and Hindi. Samanijis, volunteer teachers and guests teach classes.</p>
<p>JVB NJ Gyanshala follows a structured 3-year rolling curriculum and a systematic approach aligned with its goals. Curriculum covers topics such as Jain Philosophy, Jain History, Jain Mantras &amp; Shlokas, Jain Prayers &amp; Rituals, Jain Festivals &amp; Pilgrimages, Preksha Yoga &amp; Meditation and Hindi Language.</p>
<p>Children are divided into four Jainism groups based on their school grade levels, where they spend time until they are ready for the next group. The groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Sanskar Group – Grades Pre K-4<br />
  Gyan Group – Grades K, 1 &amp; 2<br />
  Darshan Group – Grades 3, 4 &amp; 5<br />
  Charitra Group – Grades 6 &amp; up</p>
<p>Hindi groups are different from Jainism groups and are based on the individual abilities of students.</p>
<p>Study materials are provided to all students. To strengthen their understanding of the study material, students are quizzed periodically and are assigned homework. They also participate in various class projects. Certificate of completion is awarded to all students who complete all tests and projects and meet attendance requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, students are provided with opportunities to showcase their talents and their understanding of Jain concepts and values through participation in various activities during JVBNA functions.</p>
