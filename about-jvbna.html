<h3>Vision</h3>
              <p>JVBNA envisions an enlightened citizen of this beautiful planet-Individual and masses.</p>
              <h3>Mission</h3>
              <ul class="featurette">
                <li>To spread the universal message of Jain philosophy and Jain wisdom to the world.                  </li>
                <li>To cultivate an atmosphere that nurtures non-violence (ahimsa), restraint (seiyam) and the philosophy of multiple aspects of the truth (anekantvaad) and thereby leads to spiritual enlightenment for human kind.                  </li>
                <li>To create an environment that fosters unity and social harmony for all mankind.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Inspiration</h3>
              <p>JVBNA derived its inspiration from Acharya Tulsi and Acharya Mahapragya based on the universal message of Tirthankar (Lord) Mahavira. Presently it receives the inspiration from Acharya Mahashraman (the eleventh supreme head of JSTO).</p>
              <h3>Purpose</h3>
              <p>Even after appreciating the virtues of Ahimsa, self-restrain and respect for divergent views and practices, masses lack the will power and the discipline to practice them.  With these thoughts in mind JVB (Preksha Meditation Center) presents a practical step by step approach of personal empowerment. The practice helps a person to build the inner strength resulting in a nonviolent, happy, compassionate, and contented life.
</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>JVB accomplishes mainly two activities for enriching one’s life: Scriptural Studies (Swadhyaya) and Meditation (Dhyana) for all age group.</p>
<h3>Non-Violence in day to day life</h3>
<p>JVB endeavors to cultivate a nonviolent culture in society at large. Occupation and profession, food and drinks, dress and decoration, and communication and entertainment all these are the part and partial of individual’s life. </p>

<p>JVB organizes such programs that give a clear understanding, knowledge and courage to adopt the nonviolent culture with confidence in every field of life.</p>
<h3>Health Education for Peaceful Life</h3>
<p>Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Our mental and emotional state not only affects our attitudes but has a direct impact on our physical health. </p>

<p>Today scientists have understood and published the negative impact on health caused by stress and other negative emotions. For example, hyperacidity causes negative thoughts in us, deposit of sugar in our blood builds up the sentiments of depression that can sometimes lead to suicide, and a disproportionate amount of endocrine hormones arouses a violent attitude.  If a person does not mentally adjust to a particular ailment, the mind of the ailing person becomes a breeding ground for negative emotions. It starts with fear and horror, which gives rise to anger and hatred. Anger and hatred give rise to violent thoughts that has the potential to lead to physical violence.</p>

<p>Jain scripture has explained in detail the relationship of Himsa (violence) and Ahimsa (nonviolence), with the mental and physical state of a person. Jainism has also prescribed various methods to control and maintain our physical and mental health. Preksha is one such practical and systematic method for healthy living. If one is healthy and physically fit then that person can take care of family, enjoy the company of friends, and perform diligently at work.</p>
<h3>Preksha Meditation and Yoga</h3>
<p>Meditation and Yogasana help to establish a balance between our body and mind. It also mends our violent mind-set and awakens spirituality. Through the asana one can expel the natural and unnatural deposits of toxic substances and generate hormones and enzymes needed by the body.  Preksha insures good health and above all it inspires a nonviolent behavior.</p>  

<p>The Practice of Preksha include: Complete Relaxation with Self-Awareness, Breathing Meditation, Perception of Body, Concentration on Psychic Centers and Psychic Colors, Chanting Mantras, and Contemplation of Amity, Tolerance and Fearlessness. Regular practice of Preksha has not only helped people in overcoming drug and alcohol addiction, but has brought about a transformation where they have a positive outlook to life leading to personal empowerment.</p>
<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>JVB (Preksha Meditation Center) operates under the guidance of visiting Samaniji from Jain Vishwa Bharati, India.  In 1980 under the guidance of Late Acharya Tulsi and Acharya Mahapragya a special Jain monk status of Samani was established that removes few Jain monk restrictions allowing them to travel and introduce the message of Bhagavan Mahavira outside India. </p>

<p>Samaniji practice Ahimsa (nonviolence), Sanyam (self-restraint), and Anekant (divergent perspectives to see the truth), celibacy, and other Jain monk vows. They are committed for purity and poverty for life. </p>

<p>Samaniji are highly educated with most of them having master or higher academic degrees from reputed Indian Universities. They have been extensively trained to coach individuals towards personal advancement. These monks have deep knowledge of the religious philosophy and are experts in the practice of Preksha (yoga and meditation) and other natural health therapies. Their good knowledge of modern science, physiology and human anatomy allows them to present the benefits of Preksha and other natural therapies in a balanced manner.</p>
<h3>Programs</h3>
<p>The positive impact felt by those practicing Preksha has made this form of Yoga and meditation very popular. JVB offers various form of Preksha session to address the needs of a broad cross-section of individuals; including children, youths, elderly people, regular practitioners, and the American society at large. In addition JVB plans regular philosophical discourses, work-shops, and lectures on topics of special interest to the community. Workshop and discourses cover subjects such as; Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity, Stress Management, Anger management, and a healthy lifestyle. Special retreats and Summer Camps are conducted targeting Preksha Meditation, depicting its practical application in day-to-day life. Periodically Samanijis visit other organizations, communities and Jain centers to conduct religious or other sessions as per the specific need of the center.</p>
<p>Let us with magnanimity give each individual the religious independence in its ritualistic activities.  However let us all work together in our personal growth as more enlightened beings.</p>
